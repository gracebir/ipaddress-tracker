## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).


our users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## Get this application up and running on your locally

For running this app locally your need to:

- clone github repo locally
- then navigation to the project folder
- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- then you need create a `.env` file, and in your .env file, you will paste this `REACT_APP_API_KEY="apikey"`
- replace  `apikey` string with your api key from [https://geo.ipify.org](https://geo.ipify.org/) website
- then Run the application with `yarn start` or `npm start`
